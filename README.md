# project2

Issues:
    1. Restarted Tuesday
    2. Not so much time management, but rather work flow management. I would be working on something and get distracted with something else. That resulted in a scattered and stressful work flow.


Aspects I Would Change with More Time:
    1. I would use a different CSS framework. Skeleton is very simple, and therefore was exactly what I needed by the time I got around to styling, but it's a little too bare bones fro the look I was originally going for.
    2. I wanted to figure out a way for the user to be able to play audio or watch a video on the show page.  
    3. Would have liked to style with cards, rather than a table or lists
    4. Redo/update the header so it doesn't have that ugly "Canva" bar below it
