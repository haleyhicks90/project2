# Unit 2 Project

This app was made in an effort to demonstrate the knowledge I've learned thus far in General Assembly's SEIR course. This is a Unit 2 Project.

The idea for this app came to me after being inspired by a previous student's "Decolonize my Audition" app that was used as an example of other student's Unit 2 Projects.
I began this project with an entirely different idea, but I couldn't stop thinking about this subject matter and figured I might as well build the app around a topic I am passionate about.

The Modern Mountain Music app was designed to introduce the user to a handful of bluegrass-adjacent artists who not only put out amazing music but who also use their lyrics to introduce progressive subject matter to their audiences.
This subject matter includes but is not limited to:
    - addiction
    - LGBT storytelling
    - slavery

The user has the ability to navigate through the app. They can view band's individual pages, edit information about the bands, delete a band, and add a new band.  



### Languages Used
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JavaScript
    - Node.js
    - Mongoose
    - xpress
    - EJS

### Skills Implemented
    - EJS Partials
    - CSS framework (Skeleton)
    - README formatting

### Issues:
    - I started over from scratch three days before this project was due, so in my rush to connect all my routes I sacrificed some styling and extra functionality.
    - Time management was not so much an issue for me, but rather work flow management. I would be working on something and get distracted with something else. That resulted in a scattered and stressful work flow.

### Aspects I Would Change with More Time:
    - I would use a different CSS framework. Skeleton is very simple, and therefore was exactly what I needed by the time I got around to styling, but it's a little too bare bones for the look I was originally going for.
    - I wanted to figure out a way for the user to be able to play audio or watch a video on the show page.  
    - I would have liked to style with cards, rather than a table or lists.
    - I would redo/update the header so it doesn't have that ugly "Canva" bar below it.
